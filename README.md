Lessons Learned:
1. Terminal commands are awesome.
2. Creating a fake company is harder than it sounds.
3. Start with writing the html and putting all the content needed in the page. Then do the formatting.
4. Start formatting with font styles and colors, background colors, text sizes.
5. Had to go back and forth between styling the flexbox and the rest of the styles. Made it harder to keep track of things because of keeping the flexboxing separate from the rest. Better to keep all the styles together and just edit in place.
